 Introduction                                                                           
                                                                                
This project consist of developing a recommendation system from the data provided by IBM Watson Studio platform. The scope of this project is to analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to the users about new articles that they might like.


Project motivation
In the IBM Watson Studio, there is a large collaborative community ecosystem of articles, datasets, notebooks, and other A.I. and ML. assets. Users of the system interact with all of this.Within this scope, we created this recommendation system project to enhance the user experience and connect them with assets. This personalizes the experience for each user.


Data Files
For the purpose of this project we have used the below outlined datasets available at IBM Watson Studio platform:
1. articles_community.csv
2. user-item-interactions.csv
3. user_item_matrix.p

Libraries used
Some of the packages and libraries used for this project are:

sentence_transformers
pandas
numpy
CountVectorizer
cosine_similarity


Methedology

For understanding the user article interactions behavior we have analyzed the datasets by buliding two types of recommendation system.

1. User-Based Collaborative Filtering System

This recommendation system utilzed the ranking assigned to different articles by the current and previous users at the platform. The ratings was mainly generated by the user-article interactions and thus was considered by the Rank Based Recommendation System. This recommendation system was an optimal solution to the problem where the users was new to the platform.

2. Content Based Recommendation System

This recommendation system made used of the document description and document full name fields for understanding the patterns in the document contents. This recommenation system was able to identify and recommend some of the articles that the new users will find useful if the user have already read articles that the falling within algorithims prediction boundaries. 


Outcome

Both the Rank Based Recommendation System and Content Based Recommendation System was able to provide suitable recommenation predictions with high accuracy rate.
